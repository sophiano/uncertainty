# Docs

This repository contains the documentation of the package in the form of a 
jupyter notebook. 

The notebook details the procedure to extract the long-term error from Ns, Ng and Nc. It also explains how to compute the short-term error, the error at minima, the reference of the network and the other desired products that are not directly related to the monitoring.

## Instructions

The jupyter notebooks can be opened online at this [link](https://jupyter.org/try).
